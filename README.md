# Electree

This project is our submission to the Fortum challenge: SMART ELECTRICITY as part of Junction 2017 event. The details of the challenge are available at [Junction website](https://hackjunction.com/challenges/smart-electricity).

## Inspiration
Houses are getting smarter with better sensors and remote controls, however, are we as customers adapting to our smarter homes? The data might be there in view for us, but maybe we need something more engaging to keep us motivated about our consumption. Our team tackled this challenge with smart combination of data visualization and cheerful graphics to provide engaging service for monitor energy consumption. Not to mention, why not contribute by planting trees while we are on it?

## What it does
Electree focuses on providing consumers fair comparison to their electricity consumption with others. This comparison is exquisitely visualized by growing trees. Each month there is a new tree to grow with unique visuals to that month. The current month's tree grows if the customer fares better than consumption average of their local area / similar households on that day. The app displays the Sun shining or hidden behind the cloud coverage to help customers get an instant grasp on whether they are progressing towards their goal.

At the end of each month, the current progress on the tree is saved to the consumer's gallery among the accomplishments of the previous months. Each fully grown tree can be shared with in the social media. Honoring Fortum's mission "For a cleaner world", each virtual tree can be used to donate to plant trees into our environment.
